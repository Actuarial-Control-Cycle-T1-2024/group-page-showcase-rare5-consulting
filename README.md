## Objectives
SuperLife is one of the main life insurance carriers in the country of Lumaria. In the last 23 years, SuperLife has sold two life insurance products: single-premium whole life insurance (SPWL) and 20-year term life insurance (T20). The company is looking to build a health incentive program that aims to achieve its objectives of:

- Incentivising healthy behaviours through active participation in the program,
- Decreasing expected mortality,
- Increasing life insurance sales,
- Improving product marketability and competitiveness and,
- Adding economic value to the company.
  
In this report, we have proposed a health incentive program that consists of three main phases: Gamifying Health, a Smoking Cessation Program and Holistic Prevention and Educational Programs. Through the implementation of the programs, we are confident that SuperLife will achieve all five objectives.
